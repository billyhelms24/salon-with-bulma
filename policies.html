        LATE ARRIVAL POLICY
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        At <em><b>Free To Be Me Salon</b></em>, we understand that unforeseen circumstances can sometimes lead to
        delays. In order to provide the best service to all of our clients, we have implemented the following late
        arrival policy:
      </p>
      <div class="content">
        <ol>
          <li><b>15-Minute Grace Period:</b> We provide a 15-minute grace period for clients who arrive late to their
            scheduled hair appointments. During this time, we will do our best to accommodate your service without
            compromising the experience of other clients or our stylists' schedules.</li>

          <li><b>Service Adjustment:</b> If you arrive within the 15-minute grace period, we will strive to complete
            your scheduled service. However, please note that the appointment duration may need to be adjusted to ensure
            that our stylists can provide the same level of care and attention to all clients.</li>

          <li><b>Rescheduling:</b> If you arrive more than 15 minutes late, we may need to reschedule your appointment.
            This is to ensure that both you and our other clients receive the full benefits of our services. We
            understand that delays can happen, and we will do our best to find another suitable time for your
            appointment.</li>

          <li><b>Courtesy Call:</b> If you anticipate being late for your appointment, please call us at 614.529.8650 to
            let us know. While we cannot guarantee that we can
            accommodate late arrivals, your courtesy call will help us manage our schedule more effectively and consider
            possible adjustments.</li>

          <li><b>No-Show Policy:</b> In the event that you do not show up for your appointment and have not informed us
            of your delay or cancellation, our standard no-show policy will apply. This may include a cancellation fee
            or a requirement to pre-pay for future appointments.</li>

        No-Show and Late Cancellation Policy
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        At <em><b>Free To Be Me Salon</b></em>, we strive to provide exceptional service to all our valued clients. To
        ensure that we can accommodate everyone and manage our schedule effectively, we have established the following
        no-show and late cancellation policy with considerations for the frequency of late cancellations and no-shows:
      </p>
      <div class="content">
        <ol>
          <li><b>Notification of Delay or Cancellation:</b> If you anticipate being unable to make it to your
            appointment or need to reschedule, we kindly request that you provide us with at least 4 hours' notice. This
            allows us to adjust our schedule and accommodate other clients.</li>

          <li><b>No-Show Policy:</b> If you fail to show up for a scheduled appointment without prior notice, or if you
            cancel your appointment within 4 hours of the scheduled start time, you will be considered a "no-show" and a
            50% deposit will be required to rebook (refer to 'Rebooking Deposit Requirement').</li>

          <li><b>Late Cancellation Policy:</b> If you cancel an appointment within 48 hours of its start time, it will
            be noted as a late cancellation on your account. After two late cancellations within a 6-month period, a 50%
            deposit is required for rebooking future services (refer to 'Rebooking Deposit Requirement'). Late-cancel
            and no-show notices are automatically removed from the account after 6 months without any further
            occurrences.</li>

          <li><b>Rebooking Deposit Requirement:</b> We will require a 50% deposit to rebook a future appointment only if
            there are two late cancellations or a single no-show within a 6-month period.</li>

          <li><b>Deposit Redemption:</b> The 50% deposit will only be forfeited if you subsequently no-show for the
            rebooked appointment. In all other cases, the deposit will be fully redeemed towards your service payment.
          </li>

          <li><b>Special Considerations:</b> We understand that emergencies and unexpected situations can arise. If you
            have a valid reason for missing an appointment, please contact us as soon as possible to discuss your
            situation.</li>

        Product Return Policy
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        At <em><b>Free To Be Me Salon</b></em>, we are dedicated to providing you with products that enhance your beauty
        and well-being. We understand that circumstances can change, leading to the need for product returns. To ensure
        a fair and efficient process, we have established the following product return policy:
      </p>
      <div class="content">
        <ol>
          <li><b>Return Window:</b> We accept product returns within 14 days from the original purchase date. Products
            returned after this period will not be eligible for return or exchange.</li>
          <li><b>Eligible Returns:</b> We accept returns for products that have been minimally used and are still in
            good condition. Opened products can be returned as long as they have been used only to a limited extent. We
            reserve the right to reject returns for products that show signs of excessive use, tampering, or missing
            contents beyond what could be reasonably used in the given timeframe.</li>

          <li><b>Return Options:</b> For eligible returns, you have the following options:</li>

          <ol type="a">
            <li><em><b>Store Credit:</b></em> We can provide you with store credit equivalent to the value of the
              returned product. This credit can be applied towards any service or product available at <em><b>Free To Be
                  Me Salon</b></em>.</li>

            <li><em><b>Exchange:</b></em> You can choose to exchange the returned product for another item offered by
              our salon.</li>

            <li><em><b>Refund:</b></em> We offer refunds to the original payment method used during the purchase. Please
              allow up to 1 business day for the refund to be processed and reflected in your account.</li>
          </ol>

          <li><b>Condition of Returned Products:</b> To be considered for a return, the product must be in its original
            condition, with packaging and labels intact. We will not accept returns for products that are nearly empty
            or have been used extensively, as this would be beyond reasonable use within the specified return period.
          </li>

          <li><b>Proof of Purchase:</b> A valid proof of purchase, such as a receipt or order confirmation, is required
            for all returns. If the purchase was made in our salon, please present the original receipt.</li>

          <li>
            <b>Return Process:</b> To initiate a product return, kindly contact our salon at 614.529.8650 or
            booking@freetobemesalon.com. Our team will guide you through the return process, provide return
            instructions, and assist in determining the best available option for your return.

        Unsatisfactory Service Policy
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        At <em><b>Free To Be Me Salon</b></em>, our goal is to provide you with the best salon experience and hair
        services possible. If you find yourself unsatisfied with a service you have received, we are committed to
        addressing your concerns and finding a solution that meets your expectations. To ensure a fair and effective
        resolution process, we have established the following service return policy:
      </p>
      <div class="content">
        <ol>
          <li><b>Timeframe for Concerns:</b> If you are unhappy with a hair service you received, you have up to 1 week
            from the date of the service to contact us and communicate your concerns.</li>
          <li><b>In-Person Consultation:</b> To effectively understand and address your concerns, we require that you
            visit our salon in person for a consultation. This step is crucial for our stylists to assess your hair and
            discuss the best course of action to resolve the issue.</li>
          <li><b>Discussion and Resolution:</b> During the in-person consultation, we will thoroughly discuss the
            reasons for your dissatisfaction and collaboratively determine the best way to move forward. Depending on
            the nature of the issue, possible solutions may include:</li>
          <ol type="a">
            <li><em><b>Redo:</b></em> If the issue can be corrected, we may offer to redo the service with the goal of
              meeting your expectations. In some cases, only a minor touch-up may be all that's needed to address the
              concern.</li>

            <li><em><b>Refund:</b></em> If we determine that the service cannot be satisfactorily corrected, we may
              discuss the possibility of a refund. Refunds will be processed in person and based on a thorough
              assessment of the situation. We do not issue refunds or make decisions over the phone. Since the nature of
              hair concerns requires a physical assessment, all discussions and resolutions will take place during an
              in-person consultation at our salon.</li>
          </ol>

          <li><b>How to Initiate the Process:</b> To begin the service return process, please contact us at
            614-529-8650 within 1 week of the service date. Our team will assist you in scheduling an in-person
            consultation and guide you through the next steps.</li>

          <li><b>Our Commitment:</b> Your satisfaction is our priority, and we are dedicated to finding the best
            solution to ensure you are happy with your hair services. Our skilled stylists are trained to address a wide
            range of hair concerns, and we will work with you to achieve the desired outcome.</li>
